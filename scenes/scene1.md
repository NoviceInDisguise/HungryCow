# Morning on the farm

## Shot 1

1. Start with view of sun rising over some distant snow-capped mountains

2. Leave enough time to overlay title somewhere here

3. *Sound of rooster crowing*

4. Slowly pan down to a view of farm (barn, silo etc.) and fenced pasture, with the cow inside (near the edge, in the last bit of remotely green-looking grass).  

> Note: The Tree shouldn't yet be visible in this shot, so the camera will have to be looking at the farm from the direction of the forest/Tree etc.

## Shot 2

5. Cut to a close in shot of the cow grazing on the last yellow-green tuft of grass

6. Cow moves forward (perhaps feebly swatting at some flies with it's tail) and bonks their head on a fence post.

7. *Sound of grumpy cow*

8. Cut to a view of the cows face, cow's expression lights up
